      to be practical! More seriously though, there just isn't any reason 
      why you can't build it yourself. A compiler is a deterministic 
      process: given a particular input file and command line, it will 
      always produce the same output. If this isn't working, you either have 
      the wrong input files (ie. your copy of Allegro is broken in some

      Your mileage may vary. Some people have reported problems, while 
      others say that it works fine. I don't have access to NT myself, so 
      there is nothing I can do about it either way, and to be honest I

      to make Windows programs. If you want to run DOS programs, use DOS!

@@   Does Allegro work under OpenDOS?
</font>
      Yes, but with some caveats. If you are using the OpenDOS version of

      on the EMM386.EXE device line in your config.sys). You should also

      You can't. The limit is imposed by the VGA hardware, not by Allegro. 
      To access more than 256k of video memory you need to use an SVGA mode, 
      which means either switching to a higher resolution or getting a copy 
      of the SciTech Display Doctor, which provides several low resolution
      SVGA modes.

      It does for some people, but not for others. The problem is that

      write a driver for it. Complain to them, or buy a different card from 
      a more reasonable manufacturer.

<li><font size="+1">
@@   Why does DOS Allegro play sounds so much quieter than in Windows?
</font>
      This might be because you have the volume set very low: try changing 
      this in the setup program. Also, Allegro is mixing several sounds into 
      a single output buffer, unlike the Windows sound player that only 
      plays one sample at a time, so each individual sound can only get a 
      smaller percentage of the total output volume. This is just the price 
      you pay for multiple output channels. If you don't like it, use the 
      setup program to tweak the number of channels: this can be any power 
      of two less than or equal to 64, and the smaller you make it, the 
      louder the sound will be. Alternatively, use set_volume_per_voice(), 
      described in the docs. This will enable you to adjust the overall 
      volume of Allegro's digital sound output.

      For more general things like the sound, VESA, and mode-X routines, 
      this would be very difficult to do because the drivers depend on a lot 
      of helper functions from the core lib. The djgpp DXE format is nowhere

      It depends on exactly what you are doing. If your images are totally

      probably be faster to use a regular bitmap with the blit() function. 
      If your graphics contain masked areas, an RLE sprite will almost 
      always be both smaller and faster than the draw_sprite() function. 
      Compiled sprites are in general quite a bit faster than both the 
      others for masked images, and slightly faster for opaque graphics, but 
      this is far more variable. They are at their best with small sprites, 
      on older machines and in mode-X, and may actually be slower than

@\   Why not make a "lite" version of Allegro?
@@   I don't need any of the sound, maths, or GUI routines...

      There is no need. The linker will only include the parts of the 
      library that you actually use, so if you don't call any of, say, the 
      texture mapping or FLIC playing functions, they will be left out of 
      your executable. This doesn't work perfectly because a lot of the 
      Allegro code uses tables of function pointers that cause some 
      unnecessary routines to be linked in, so the majority of the graphics 
      functions will be included in every executable, but I have tried to 
      keep this to a minimum. See allegro.txt for information about more 
      precise ways to remove some of the graphics and sound drivers.

      No. I think this sort of hardware support would be most useful as part
