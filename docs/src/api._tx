Introduction

   Once Allegro 4.0 is released, we plan to maintain Application Programming
   Interface compatibility for the rest of the 4.x series. For example, that
   means you will be able to compile your program written for version 4.0
   with version 4.0.23 or version 4.2.1 of the library. However, in order to
   fix some inconsistencies of the 4.0 API, we may make exceptions to the
   rule and break strict API compatibility in a few cases. But this is
   guaranteed to never happen in a series for which major and minor version
   numbers are fixed; in other words, two versions that differ from each
   other only by the revision (3rd) number will be strictly API compatible.

Changes between 4.0.x and 4.1.x series
<ul><li>
   The 'aspect' parameter of get_camera_matrix() and get_camera_matrix_f()
   strictly conforms to the documentation; in particular, setting it to 1
   instructs the functions to do no scaling. This was not the case before,
   because the functions multiplied this aspect ratio by 4/3.
<li>
   Menus created from a DIALOG array (by using d_menu_proc for the proc pointer)
   now correctly use the w and h fields as a minimum for their inclusive
   dimensions (in the same way as all other GUI elements). Before, they would
   draw the border outside of this dimension (1 pixel overdraw with other GUI
   elements), and also add an additional 'shadow' to the right and the bottom
   (2 pixels overdraw with other GUI elements).
<li>
   The 'retrace_count' variable and the 'retrace_proc' callback function 
   take into account the refresh rate (if it is known) when the retrace
   simulator is not installed. This was not the case before, except under
   Windows.
<li>
   The default value for the mouse configuration variable 'emulate_three'
   has been changed to 'no' in all cases (even if you have a 2-button mouse).
</ul>
