Introduction

   Once Allegro 4.0 is released, we plan to maintain Application Programming
   Interface compatibility for the rest of the 4.x series. For example, that
   means you will be able to compile your program written for version 4.0
   with version 4.0.23 or version 4.2.1 of the library. However, in order to
   fix some inconsistencies of the 4.0 API, we may make exceptions to the
   rule and break strict API compatibility. But this is guaranteed to never
   happen in a series for which major and minor version numbers are fixed;
   in other words, two versions that differ from each other only by the
   revision (third) number will be strictly API compatible.

Changes between 4.0.x and 4.1.x series
<ul><li>
   The 'aspect' parameter of get_camera_matrix() and get_camera_matrix_f()
   strictly conforms to the documentation; in particular, setting it to 1
   instructs the functions to do no scaling. This was not the case before,
   because the functions multiplied this aspect ratio by 4/3.
</ul>
