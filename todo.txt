This is the public TODO list for the Allegro Game/Multimedia Library.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates or comments can be sent to the TODO list maintainer Peter Wang
<tjaden@alphalink.com.au> or to the Allegro developer's mailinglist
<conductors@canvaslink.com>, preferrably with the text [TODO] in the subject.


General (Platform independant) todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- find solution or API to timer/multithread problem
- don't use BITMAPs for zbuffers
- Unified color conversion routines for all windowed gfx drivers (now
  that we have a Mac port, it's a total of 4 possible windowed drivers,
  and the need of an unified set of window updating routines is stronger)
  [Eric or Angelo: remove this when it's done]
- implement fetch_mode_list() method on all GFX drivers that has the
  functionality to support this.
- check and/or fix compilation with gcc 3.0
- asm draw_sprite et al. don't work with sub-bitmaps
- include dat2c once finished
- resolve findfirst issues
- remove joystick control from main part of setup
- bug in menus related to auto-opening patch

DOS todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Win32 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DirectInput 5 joystick driver
- Investigate mouse problem with USB Wacom Tablet
- Fix 'mouse pointer not hidden' bug (likely a race condition)
- Add backward playing to the DirectSound driver
- Sound code cleanup (wdsinput.c, wsndmix.c, wsndwo.c)
- Make Allegro return focus to the calling app

Linux todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- keyboard set_rate
- Find out more about sched_yield
- switch to proper SRPMs and RPMS (esp. now that we have modules)
- fix fb 24-bit scrolling (allegro presuming padding?)
- fbcon-as-module patch

X11 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- remove `dga_mouse' config var when appropriate (newer servers have fixed
  the bug this works around).  Wait until XF86 4.0 propagated..
- speed up X11 driver
- key[] should not be internationalised (e.g. KEY_S should always be set
  for the key two to the right of CapsLock).  If we can't solve this in
  time, include bukinm's xkeymap program.
- play nice with WindowMaker (there's no appicon, for one)

Unix todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- check which parts of makefiles break with non-GNU make
- update ALSA drivers to latest stable version
- "still PIC-related problems with X lib, waiting for XFree people"
- disable pthreads option in configure

Macintosh todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- implement os_version & os_revision.
- don't use argv or argc on main function, now this not work.
- don't use printf, stdout, stderr, stdin function related use allegro_message.
- allegro_message truncates message to 254 chars.
- low resolutions like 320x200 doesn't fill the entire screen.
- missing features include: hardware accelleration, virtual screens,
  scrolling, joystick, switching, windowed modes, true 16 & 32 bpp
  colordepths.
- fix midi playback.
- Update the docs.
- Window close button?

BeOS todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Write a safe windowed driver using BBitmap
- Keyboard driver rewrite
- Launching programs from the Be menu still doesn't work (Tracker works though)

QNX todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- implement os_version & os_revision.
- Video bitmaps and acceleration support in fullscreen mode
- Display switching in fullscreen mode
- Fix the makefile
- Update the docs
- Use standard Unix build system (autoconf, etc.) if possible

Wishlist
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- More hardware accelerated functions? Trans/lit sprites come to mind.
- framebuffer hardware accel via XFB or DirectFB (?) library/driver
- Better get_config_text support, with multiple fallback configuration
  files (you can have lot's of them under linux), which is not supported at
  the moment (IIRC two at most).
- Split setup in two: user program and configuration library. This would
  allow easier merge process of configuration program into real user
  programs, as well as modifying the interface and "look'n'feel". The lib
  should be written in such a way to support future additions without the
  need of rewritting the user setup ui.
- Play with switch_in/out X events, just for the sake of it :-)
- OSS MIDI pitch bend.
- hook function to handle window resizing
- DirectMusic 6 MIDI driver
- Add caching system to speed up filename#object and load_datafile_object()
- Video overlay gfx driver under QNX
- rewrite set_gfx_mode
- size_t where appropriate (get more opinions first)
- make zipwin.sh work with mingw32.
- make allegro not use uconvert static buffer; reserve for user
- more modularity under Linux
- XVideo driver under XFree86
