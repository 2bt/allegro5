---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the public TODO list for the Allegro Game/Multimedia Library.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates or comments can be sent to the TODO list maintainter Peter Wang
<tjaden@alphalink.com.au> or to the Allegro developer's mailinglist
<conductors@canvaslink.com>, preferrably with the text [TODO] in the subject.


General (Platform independant) todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add caching system to speed up filename#object and load_datafile_object()
- Add a general windowed gfx updater with color conversion, to be used by
  specific ports
- Convert more programs/examples to the new GFX_SAFE behaviour
- Clean up some bad formatting stuff introduced by the Mac port.

Win32 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mouse doesn't move fast enough when using hires modes in Windows
- Fix pageflipping problem with overlay driver
- Win32 port doesn't build when ALLEGRO_MMX is not defined.
- Update docs to mention cross-compilation support.

Linux todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Enable autodetection for SVGAlib driver.
- Fix strange fb_init bug when user request a non-existant resolution in
  his /etc/fb.modes file. Oh well, this doesn't seem to be so important,
  since it's pretty inexpensive to write a correct fb.modes file and quite
  rare to request exotic resolutions, but should be dealt with at least
  before 4.0.
- Rewrite GGI driver
- Linux keyboard set_rate 
- Find out more about sched_yield
- svgalib leaves crap on screen at exit
  maybe svgalib problem
  work around it if necessary (it's really annoying)
- vt switching in BACKAMNESIA mode only causes font weirdity in text
  mode on a Voodoo Banshee (using SVGAlib VESA and BANSHEE drivers), even
  if I cheat and use vga_flip.  Font returns after program quits.

X11 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- num-lock state in X window may not match state on keyboard

Macintosh todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- allegro_message truncates message to 254 chars.
- low resolutions like 320x200 doesn't fill the entire screen.
- some speed-ups would be nice.
- missing features include: hardware accelleration, virtual screens,
  scrolling, midi, joystick, switching, windowed modes, true 16 & 32 bpp
  colordepths.
- Update the docs.

BeOS todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix problem with 3d routines
- Add display switching support to fullscreen driver
- Write a safe windowed driver using BBitmap
- Support for compiling as shared object would be nice
- zbuffering fix under BeOS
- shared library support
- code cleanup

Supposedly fixed. (confirmation wanted)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Talk to Calin about merging latest P3D rendering stuff
- Windows (DirectSound) sample looping isn't right

Wishlist
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Unified color conversion routines for all windowed gfx drivers (now
  that we have a Mac port, it's a total of 4 possible windowed drivers,
  and the need of an unified set of window updating routines is stronger)
- More hardware accelerated functions? Trans/lit sprites come to
  mind.
- framebuffer hardware accel via XFB library/driver
- Better documentation for the unicode routines: saying that ustrcpy,
  ustrcmp, etc, work like the libc routines isn't very beautiful, and
  doesn't allow me to press Ctrl+F1 in my editor and get a help on the
  function :) Therefore, documentation text for each function.
- Better get_config_text support, with multiple fallback configuration
  files (you can have lot's of the under linux), which is not supported at
  the moment (IIRC two at most).
- Split setup in two: user program and configuration library. This would
  allow easier merge process of configuration program into real user
  programs, as well as modifying the interface and "look'n'feel". The lib
  should be written in such a way to support future additions without the
  need of rewritting the user setup ui.
- Play with switch_in/out X events, just for the sake of it :-)
- merge am's menu auto popup patch
- separate fullscreen option from XDFS, XDGA, etc.
- OSS MIDI pitch bend.
