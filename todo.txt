This is the public TODO list for the Allegro Game/Multimedia Library.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates or comments can be sent to the TODO list maintainer Peter Wang
<tjaden@alphalink.com.au> or to the Allegro developer's mailinglist
<conductors@canvaslink.com>, preferrably with the text [TODO] in the subject.


General (Platform independant) todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add caching system to speed up filename#object and load_datafile_object()
- Even newer GFX_SAFE behaviour (return error instead of quitting)

Win32 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update docs to mention cross-compilation support.
- Video mode switching inefficient: "don't poll drivers for acceptable
  modes before switching into them and deciding it can't do that so switches
  back to Windows"

Linux todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Enable autodetection for SVGAlib driver.
- Fix strange fb_init bug when user request a non-existant resolution in
  his /etc/fb.modes file. Oh well, this doesn't seem to be so important,
  since it's pretty inexpensive to write a correct fb.modes file and quite
  rare to request exotic resolutions, but should be dealt with at least
  before 4.0.
- Rewrite GGI driver
- Linux keyboard set_rate 
- Find out more about sched_yield
- svgalib leaves crap on screen at exit
  maybe svgalib problem
  work around it if necessary (it's really annoying)
- vt switching in BACKAMNESIA mode only causes font weirdity in text
  mode on a Voodoo Banshee (using SVGAlib VESA and BANSHEE drivers), even
  if I cheat and use vga_flip.  Font returns after program quits.

X11 todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- num-lock state in X window may not match state on keyboard
- remove `dga_mouse' config var when appropriate (newer servers have fixed
  the bug this works around).  Wait until XF86 4.0 propagated..
- DGA2 driver doesn't work for me [pw]

Macintosh todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- allegro_message truncates message to 254 chars.
- low resolutions like 320x200 doesn't fill the entire screen.
- some speed-ups would be nice.
- missing features include: hardware accelleration, virtual screens,
  scrolling, midi, joystick, switching, windowed modes, true 16 & 32 bpp
  colordepths.
- Update the docs.

BeOS todos:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add display switching support to fullscreen driver
- Write a safe windowed driver using BBitmap
- shared library support
- code cleanup

Supposedly fixed. (confirmation wanted)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Talk to Calin about merging latest P3D rendering stuff
- Windows (DirectSound) sample looping isn't right

Wishlist
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Unified color conversion routines for all windowed gfx drivers (now
  that we have a Mac port, it's a total of 4 possible windowed drivers,
  and the need of an unified set of window updating routines is stronger)
- More hardware accelerated functions? Trans/lit sprites come to
  mind.
- framebuffer hardware accel via XFB library/driver
- Better get_config_text support, with multiple fallback configuration
  files (you can have lot's of the under linux), which is not supported at
  the moment (IIRC two at most).
- Split setup in two: user program and configuration library. This would
  allow easier merge process of configuration program into real user
  programs, as well as modifying the interface and "look'n'feel". The lib
  should be written in such a way to support future additions without the
  need of rewritting the user setup ui.
- Play with switch_in/out X events, just for the sake of it :-)
- merge Angelo's menu auto popup patch
- separate fullscreen option from XDFS, XDGA, etc.
- OSS MIDI pitch bend.
- function to get a list of supported video modes
- hook function to handle window resizing and another one to handle
  window closing
- dynamically linked wrappers for drivers under Linux
